The purpose of this project was to create a game of Rock Paper Scissors that could be played on a simple GUI. The skills that I have demonstrated through this project are my problem solving skills, the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and DOM manipulation by adding event listeners to make the webpage more interactive.
